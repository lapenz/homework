<h2>ITÂ´S TIME TO DO YOUR EVERYWEEK HOMEWORK!</h2>
You have already listened to LISTEN AND LEARN AUDIO to get prepared for your class.
Now you are listening to the same audio in order to fill the blanks, according to the listened sentences.
After completing the whole section, you are supposed to submit your homework by pressing the bottom SUBMIT.
The homework is an essential exercise for you to practice your spelling skill, as well as to help you memorize the content you have learned in your class.
We remind you that you are NOT going to be allowed to take the tests, unless you submit your homework (referring to the lessons of the test) and get a higher score than 70.
If you have any doubt, please talk to your teacher.
