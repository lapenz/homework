<h2>ITÂ´S TIME TO DO YOUR EVERYWEEK HOMEWORK!</h2>
You have already listened to LISTEN AND LEARN AUDIO to get prepared for your class.<br/>
Now you are listening to the same audio in order to fill the blanks, according to the listened sentences.<br/>
After completing the whole section, you are supposed to submit your homework by pressing the button SUBMIT.<br/>
The homework is an essential exercise for you to practice your spelling skill, as well as to help you memorize the content you have learned in your class.<br/>
We remind you that you are NOT going to be allowed to take the tests, unless you submit your homework (referring to the lessons of the test) and get a higher score than 70.<br/>
If you have any doubt, please talk to your teacher.
